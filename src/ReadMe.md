Shell Scripts
-------------

The shell scripts in this folder are configured for a Linux system.  Minor changes may be needed depending on the details of your installation.  The scripts should also work on Mac OSX with minor changes as suggested in some of the commented lines.  Before attempting to run the scripts, verify that the user has execution permissions (run `ls -l` on the directory *src/* to display file permissions).  If not, the file can be made executable by running `chmod u+x` *filename.sh*
