This folder is reserved for output files from the program thresh.  Note that the file Thlast.txt records the times of the latest data processed.  If you edit the parameters in the file thresh\_in.txt in the parent directory of this folder, you will need to remove two or more files from this folder (NWS/data) before attempting to run thresh again with the new parameters.  The first is Thlast.txt.  The second is a group of one or more files named ThArchiveSS.txt, where SS is the station number of each rain gauge or weather station listed in thresh\_in.txt.
