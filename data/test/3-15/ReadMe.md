This folder, *data/test/3-15*. receives output of the shell script *roc.sh* (and the program *tsthresh*, which is invoked by *roc.sh*).

For this example, the script *roc.sh* extracts output from the program *thresh* using hourly precipitation input for the National Weather Service station at Everett-Paine Field (KPAE). The *thresh* output for this station are stored in the file *ThArchive02.txt*.    Although the practice data set is too small to give statistically meaningful results, the output stored in the file *roc_output.txt* demonstrate how Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) methods can be applied to evaluating the performance of rainfall thresholds.
