This folder is reserved for output files from the program *thresh*.  Note that the file *Thlast.txt* records the times of the latest data processed.  If you edit the parameters in the file *thresh\_in.txt* in the parent directory of this folder, you will need to remove the file *Thlast.txt* from this folder (*Forecast/output*) before attempting to run *thresh* again with the new parameters.
